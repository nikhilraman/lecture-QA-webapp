# lecture-QA-webapp

Web Application for a Piazza like Q/A service for in class help. Has some Reddit like features. 

Note: This App uses DynamoDB on the backend and in order to test the application one should should run the necessary loader scripts to ensure the tables are setup. This requires valid AWS credentials. To start the application, run 'npm start' nad navigate to whatever endpoint the site is hosted at. For local testing this will likely be 'localhost:8080'.
